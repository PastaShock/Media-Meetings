		#### Video Production
		
		The video production team is going to be a pair of people that both have video/photo and video editing experience. They will be using a handheld/tripod mounted camera to shoot video announcements, auxiliary events and will need to be nimble. Turnaround time for these sort of projects is usually short. I want to do research on how much it will cost to equip this team with the necessary equipment. is it Panasonic, Sony, Blackmagic, Canon or Nikon kit, I do not know.

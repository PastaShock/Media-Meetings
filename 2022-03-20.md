## Overview

Introduction: 

What value does the media team bring?

		the media team is going to bring value through the display of information to the congregation. Since the team is only noticed when something goes wrong, the less we are noticed, the better. We are supposed to use our allocated funds to build and maintain systems that we utilize to connect the remote congregants to the collective service.

Where does the media teams value come from?

The value of the media team comes from the passion at the point of intersection of art and technology. 
 - IN PROPRESENTER: we bring value by showing song lyrics, making it easier for congregants to follow along with songs that they may not know. In showing bible verses to show the congregation that the scripture supports what the preacher is preaching. In the announcements that show the congregation our regularly scheduled programing and upcoming events. 
 - IN LIVE STREAMING we broadcast the worship, sermon and announcements to those that are not able to make it to church on a given sunday. 
 - IN CAMERA OPERATION we give viewers in our lobby, our nurseries and  our remote congregants an up close dynamic view into our service.
 - IN GRAPHIC DESIGN we create enticing design taht grabs peoples attention and conveys the information clearly and concisley in every medium used.
 - IN VIDEO DIRECTING we bring value in dynamically offering new angles to keep the viewers attention and help convey the emotion of the worship sets and the sermons.
 - IN AUDIO ENGINEERING the value comes from a sound that is not noticably harsh or unpleasant to listen to.

## Departmental Units

Lets go over department specific topics:

### Audio

Taras can lead with how things are going and issues hes having.

- Need more outputs on stage. We are maxed out on the current aes50 boxes we have.
	- Behringer s16 would solve that issue with 8 more outs.
	- Price on Sweetwater is currently $659
	- Cat 6 is already ran because of previous stage laptop which is no longer used on stage but is now upstairs.
	- Generally this is the quickest and most simple solution to the problem.

	- Alternatively we can get midas m32c ($799) and a klark teknik dn9650 ($2099)
	- The idea here is that we would have a completely separate mixer for monitor sends
	- This would be completely headless meaning there is no physical control surface.

	- The latter is the more sophisticated solution that takes care of part of another issue which is a seperate live audio mix.
	- 96khz is what the pro 1 operates at. The dn9650 converts the audio from 96khz to 48khz.
	- The reason this is necessary is because after "testing" we continuously got "disk too slow" error when recording

- buy new main speakers with the funds we'd get from selling/trading our current pa system.

### Video

George will talk about issues that we are currently having and how we can potentially solve them.

- lack of organization

- staffing shortages

- lack of motivation?

### A/V General



### Networking

George Daniel Taras

- Teach oles how to access all the networking stuff

- Ask for any interest in the field

### Accessory Tech

Anything in regards to tech/media that hasn't been covered yet

things that may be in auxiliary rooms in the church

lobby, nursery Downstairs

## Vision

### A/V

### Network

### New Departments

#### Video Production
		
The video production team is going to be a pair of people that both have video/photo and video editing experience. They will be using a handheld/tripod mounted camera to shoot video announcements, auxiliary events and will need to be nimble. Turnaround time for these sort of projects is usually short. I want to do research on how much it will cost to equip this team with the necessary equipment. is it Panasonic, Sony, Blackmagic, Canon or Nikon kit, I do not know.
